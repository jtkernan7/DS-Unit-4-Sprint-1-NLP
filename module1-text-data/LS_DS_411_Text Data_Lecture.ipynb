    "\"Natural\" meaning - not computer languages but spoken/written human languages. The hard thing about NLP is that human languages are far less structured or consistent than computer languages. This is perhaps the largest source of difficulty when trying to get computers to \"understand\" human languages. How do you get a machine to understand sarcasm, and irony, and synonyms, connotation, denotation, nuance, and tone of voice --all without it having lived a lifetime of experience for context? If you think about it, our human brains have been exposed to quite a lot of training data to help us interpret languages, and even then we misunderstand each other pretty frequently. \n",

Words such as \"I\", \"and\", \"of\", etc. have almost no semantic meaning to us. We call these useless words \"stop words,\" because we should 'stop' ourselves from including them in the analysis. \n",

    "Most NLP libraries have built in lists of stop words that common english words: conjunctions, articles, adverbs, pronouns, and common verbs. The best practice, however, is to extend/customize these standard english stopwords for your problem's domain. If I am studying political science, I may want to exclude the word \"politics\" from my analysis; it's so common it does not add to my understanding. "
